The Chronicles of Everdale

In the northern reaches of the kingdom lies Everdale, a prosperous village nestled between the Whispering Mountains and the Silver River. The village has stood for three hundred years, founded by the explorer Aldric the Bold.

Elara Thornwood is the village's head healer. She has long auburn hair and green eyes that seem to glow when she works her craft. At thirty-two years old, she is known throughout the region for her knowledge of medicinal herbs. She lives in a small cottage at the edge of the Moonlit Grove.

Her brother, Marcus Thornwood, serves as the captain of the village guard. Unlike his sister, Marcus has dark hair and brown eyes. He is thirty-five years old and carries a sword that once belonged to their father. Marcus is married to Helena, a baker's daughter, and they have two children.

The village elder is Grandmother Sage, whose real name is Miriam Oakheart. She is ninety years old and has served as elder for forty years. She possesses the rare gift of foresight, though her visions come less frequently with age.

Recently, strange happenings have disturbed Everdale's peace. Travelers report seeing shadow creatures in the Whispering Mountains. The Silver River has begun to run cold, even in summer. Grandmother Sage has prophesied that a great darkness approaches from the east.

The Moonlit Grove is sacred to the villagers. Ancient oaks grow there, some over five hundred years old. It is said that the spirits of the forest protect those who enter with pure intentions. Elara gathers most of her herbs from this grove.

Trade relations exist between Everdale and the neighboring town of Ironhold, which lies two days' journey to the south. Ironhold is known for its blacksmiths and metal works. The current lord of Ironhold is Baron Cedric Steelhand, who has ruled for fifteen years.

The kingdom itself is ruled by Queen Seraphina from the capital city of Crownhaven, which sits three weeks' travel to the west. The queen is just twenty-five years old, having ascended to the throne after her father's death two years ago.
